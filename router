router need to be config to work

conf t
int g0/0/0/0
no shutdown
ip addr 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 the ip of the network its connected to
set the default gateway of the devices to the ip of the router 

connect the router to another router
connect using 255.255.255.252 mask
assign either .1 or .2

Add static route of the next hop for networks you are trying to go to
ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.1
ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.1
10.10.10.1 is the next hop router int

now add a static route back from the 10.10.10.1 
ip route 10.10.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2
